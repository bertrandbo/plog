This is a light and article-oriented Pelican theme. It is possible to see it in action on my [blog](http://www.bertrand-bousquet.info). IMO, this theme is more suitable for one writer only. 

This theme is a Pelican copy of [Tom Preston-Werner's Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.io). The theme is under MIT licence and the RSS icons comes from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Feed-icon.svg).

## Supported Pelican settings

This theme supports following Pelican properties :

- `MENUITEMS`
- `LINKS`: note that the blogroll is used as credits list in the footer.
- `SOCIAL`
- `GITHUB_URL`: re-use of the ribbon from [notmyidea theme](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/notmyidea-cms)
- `TWITTER_USERNAME`: re-use of the button from [Just-Read theme](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/Just-Read)

##Â Custom settings

The footer contains a block about the author. Two custom properties can be added in `pelicanconf.py`:

- `AUTHOR_DESCRIPTION`: a one-line summary about the author, his job or whatever.
- `AUTHOR_EMAIL`: the author's e-mail

These properties are optional. If not set, nothing is displayed.
